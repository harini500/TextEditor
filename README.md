# TextEditor
Your goal is to implement a simple text editor with a font family, font weight and italic selector that instantly changes the font of the entire text. Font selector must show a list of all google fonts and font weight selector shows the appropriate font weights supported for the selected font family. Italic toggle is only active if the selected font family and weight combination 
supports italic. You also need to implement auto save which saves the text and font family locally in the browser. On reloading the page,existing content should load and correct font family and variant should be selected in the dropdown.A JSON file is provided which gives a mapping between font name to various variants it supports and corresponding font urls.
